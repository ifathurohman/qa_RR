                  <p>Credit Risk Management in the digital age is a complex affair. Managing Credit Risks requires careful consideration of various factors, multi-disciplinary skills and comprehensive information such as:</p>

                    <li class="item">Reliable data on the basic 5 Cs of corporate credit risk assessment - Character, Capacity, Capital, Collateral and Conditions of a company</li>
                    <li class="item">Macroeconomic outlook</li>

                  <p>Technology advancement with AI, Blockchain, Fintech movement and other innovative business models and the vast array of data and sources adds to the challenges in effective Risks Management. Acquiring and effective use of quality data and information is critical to derive insights to survive and thrive in the volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous global business environment.  </p>
                  <h4 class="title">Key Challenges of Credit Risk Management</h4>
                  <b class="blue">Inefficient data management</b>
                  <p>Inability to access quality data when it is needed reduces competitive edge and affects customer satisfaction.</p>
                  <b class="blue">Legacy system and low automation</b>
                  <p>Human errors, disparate data sources and manual processes can create a disconnect with the customersâ€™ needs.</p>  
                  <b class="blue">Technology Mismatch</b>
                  <p>Information in traditional form prevents the efficient adoption of technology-driven credit risk management solutions and analytics, especially for Fintech disruptors.</p>
                  <b class="blue">Increasing complexity in fraudulent business practices</b>
                  <p>Fraudsters are increasingly skilled and technology-enabled. Historical data and inability to monitor changes is the weak link to fraud prevention.</p>
                  <h4 class="title">Managing Credit Risk</h4>
                  <b class="blue">Verifying your customer</b>
                  <p>There is still no substitute to knowing your customer.  This is a fundamental best practice as it provides a strong basis for all subsequent actions in the credit risk management process. To get the best results you need relevant, precise, and well-timed information.</p>
                  <b class="blue">Analyse financial performance</b>
                  <p>General practice is a 3 to 5 years financial assessment of the company to understand any financial stress or business growth opportunities.</p>
                  <b class="blue">Analyze non-financial risks</b>
                  <p>Often the most neglected area in Credit Risk Management is the domain of non-financial risks. It is essential to develop skills to evaluate those risks, with reliable data, in the following three broad areas :</p>
