            <li class="item">An  essential first step is to conduct market analysis and customer profiling to establish the primary and secondary criterion that may be used to identify and generate leads and convert them into high-value customers.</li>
            <li class="item"><p>CRM is as useful as the data it contains. To enable adoption and improve usefulness of such customer solutions, you need good quality data to maximise the CRMâ€™s effectiveness.</p>
              <b>You can generate quality data from:</b>
              <ul>
                <li class="item">External data sources such as public registry, information providers, lead generations providers</li>
                <li class="item">Internal data sources such as historical sales data, customer profiles generated from sales, operations and customer services data</li>

            <li class="item"><p>The criteria to determine the ideal customer profile need to be sufficiently broad to optimise the opportunities in the target market segment. Excessively strict rules can limit access to prospects pool and cause you to miss business opportunities</p>
            <b>Customer profiling and identifying the right criterion for leads can be based on the following:</b>
            <ul class="">
              <li class="item">What is the Industry classification to be targeted</li>
              <li class="item">What is the revenue size of the targeted companies?</li>
