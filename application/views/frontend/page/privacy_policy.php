				<ol style="list-style: disc inside none; list-style-type: decimal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">
						<li>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</li></span>
					<p>Elixir Technology collects information in several ways from different parts of our network of web sites.</p>
					<p>Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, you may be asked for your name, email address, industry, as well as other information. The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience. Once you register, you are no longer anonymous to Elixir Technology - you are given a user account and are able to take full advantage of Elixir Technology many offerings.</p>
					<p>In addition to registration, we may ask you for personal information at other times (including but not limited to) when you enter a lucky draw, contest or promotion sponsored by Elixir Technology and/or our many partners; when you make a purchase using Elixir Technology services; when you submit a listing for a web site; and when you report a problem with one of our products, sites or services. If you contact Elixir Technology we may keep a record of that correspondence. Elixir Technology also occasionally asks users to complete surveys that we use for research purposes. Wherever Elixir Technology collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.</p><span style="font-weight: bold;">
						<li> USE OF INFORMATION</li></span>
					<p>Personal information about you may be used by Elixir Technology to improve our marketing efforts, to improve our content and product offerings and to make our site more user-friendly or to serve you better. We may use your email address, your mailing address, and phone number to contact you regarding administrative notices, new product offerings, and communications relevant to your use of the site. Information that we maintain about you and information from your current and past activities on the Site, will be used in the event of disputes or troubleshooting.</p>
					<p>Elixir Technology may, from time to time, send you email regarding our products ad services. In addition, we may occasionally send you direct mail about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. On some types of Elixir Technology promotions, we will ask for your email address in order to update you on your score, entries, and status in prize drawings. When you participate in these types of promotions, you automatically receive promotion-related email. Occasionally, these promotion-related email messages may include targeted advertisements.</p><span style="font-weight: bold;">
						<li>SHARING OF INFORMATION</li></span>
					<p>In general, Elixir Technology will not disclose any of your personal information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. The following describes some of the ways that your information may be disclosed.</p>
					<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Business Partners &amp; Sponsors</span>: Elixir Technology may disclose your personal information to business partners or sponsors, but this is specifically described to you prior to data collection or prior to transferring the data. Details of shared use can be found in specific Terms of Service or Use Agreements, and lucky draws and promotions rules. Some or all data collected during an Elixir Technology promotion may be shared with a sponsor. If personally identifying data about you will be shared, we will tell you before we collect or transfer the data.</p>
					<p>Many promotions offer opportunities to request additional information from sponsors. By requesting more information, you give Elixir Technology permission to transfer your personal information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request. In many instances, only your email address will be shared. If more information will be shared with the sponsor, you will be notified prior to the transfer.</p>
					<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BizInsights</span>: If you make a purchase from a store hosted by BizInsights, or a merchant in an Elixir Technology web site, the information obtained during your visit to those stores, and the information you give such as your contact information, are provided to the merchants. This is to enable transactions to take place.</p>
					<p>Merchants listed in BizInsights or in an Elixir Technology site have separate privacy and data collection practices. Elixir Technology has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. For more information regarding the merchant, their store, and their privacy policies, return to that store's home page and click on their Information link.</p>
					<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third Party Data &amp; Data in the Aggregate</span>: Under confidentiality agreements, Elixir Technology may match user information with third party data. Also, Elixir Technology discloses aggregated user statistics (for example, 75% of our users are SMEs) in order to describe our services to current and prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.</p>
					<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other</span>: Elixir Technology may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating Elixir Technology's Terms of Service or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Elixir Technology's rights or property, other Elixir Technology users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Elixir Technology may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services.</p>
					<p>In general, Elixir Technology does not sell or rent user information to anyone. We will notify you at the time of data collection or transfer if your data will be shared with a third party and you will always have the option of not permitting the transfer.</p>
				</ol>
				<ul style="list-style: disc inside none; list-style-type: decimal;">

					<p>(5) Measure certain traffic patterns, which areas of Elixir Technology's network of web sites you might have visited, and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. We would use this research to understand how our users' habits are similar or different from one another so that we can make each new experience on Elixir Technology a better one.
